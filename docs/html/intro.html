	<h2>About me</h2>
	<p>
		My name is Yano and I live and work in Tokyo.<br />
		I started my journey as a programmer 2 years ago. I code mostly in TypeScript, but also in JavaScript, HTML, and
		CSS. In my free-time, I work on a few open-source projects, and this website is a representation of some of the
		things I've learned during this 2 years.<br />
		I like coding and looking for more oportunities to work as a developer.
